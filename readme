Code for paper 'Learning sentence representation with guidance of human attention'
This code is modified from https://github.com/jwieting/iclr2016, and we add attention models over word(averaging) model and lstm model
This is the training code for learning POS tag vectors and CCG supertag vectors and you can get the attention value together with word embeddings
